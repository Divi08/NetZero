These building blocks frame the foundation of Canada’s long term climate change mitigation strategy:\n• Electrification. The electrification of end use applications that are currently using fossil fuels.\n• Concurrent trends towards decarbonisation of the electricity generating sector are needed.\n• The significant increase in electricity demand resulting from electrification policies (e.g., doubling or more by 2050), and electricity exports, should be satisfied through low-carbon sources.\n• Canada, and North America’s, electricity future will be shaped by interprovincial and intercontinental cooperation.\n• Energy efficiency and demand side management are key to achieving deep GHG reductions.\n• Some sectors such as heavy industries, marine transportation, some heavy freight transportation, and aviation could move to lower or low-carbon fuels such as second generation biofuels or hydrogen.\n• Abatement of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons, is a priority.\n• Behavioural changes will also contribute to a low-GHG economy.\n• Focus on cities.\n• Canada’s forests and lands will continue to play an important role in sequestering substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n• The private sector has an important role to play in this respect including spurring investment and innovation towards low GHG alternatives. Carbon pricing will be an important element to achieving this objective.\n• Collaboration with provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, municipalities, business and other stakeholders.",

The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.\nGeneral requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:\nCompressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.\nWell completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.\nConditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):\nFugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.\nFacility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:\n-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;\n-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and\n-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.\nPneumatic devices:\n-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m³ per hour.\n-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.\n(https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2018/04/federal-methane-regulations-for-the-upstream-oil-and-gas-sector.html)",

The plan states that:\n• Alberta will phase out all coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2030.\n• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).\n• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.\nIn November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:\n• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021\n• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)\n• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.\n• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations. This change, in conjunction with Ministerial Orders that allow the Balancing Pool to smooth price volatility over a longer period of time, would support electricity costs remaining low and stable.",
